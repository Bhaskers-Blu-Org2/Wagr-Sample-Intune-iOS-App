# Wagr

Wagr is an open source Microsoft app that integrates Azure Active Directory Authentication Libraries (ADAL) and the [Intune App SDK for iOS](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/app-sdk-get-started). Wagr is intended to be sample code for app developers integrating the Intune App SDK for iOS into their productivity apps for iOS using [the developer guide](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/app-sdk-ios).

## Get Started

You'll need a few things to run the Wagr app with the Intune SDK for iOS. To build the app, you'll need the following:

* A Mac running OS X 10.8.5 or later
* XCode 8 or later
* If you want to test Wagr on physical devices, you'll need an Apple Signing Certificate and Provisioning Profile for your company. You can learn more about obtaining these [here](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/intune/app-wrapper-prepare-ios#apple-developer-prerequisites-for-the-app-wrapping-tool).
